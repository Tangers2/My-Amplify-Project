# My-Amplify-Project
This project leverages AWS Amplify Gen 2, a TypeScript-based, code-first developer experience (DX) for defining backend services. Amplify Gen 2 simplifies cloud infrastructure deployment by allowing frontend developers to express their app's data model, business logic, authentication, and authorization rules entirely in TypeScript.
